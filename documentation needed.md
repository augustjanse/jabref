## Architecuture and purpose of the system:
We chose the issue related to wishes for more fetchers. 
## Things mentioned in the requirements that we need to document:

1. Did you have to install a lot of additional tools to build the software? Were those tools well documented? Were other components installed automatically by the build script? Did the build conclude automatically without errors? How well do examples and tests run on your system(s)?

2. The (planned) changes affect the code and/or functionality of the software, not just documentation or
other non-executable artifacts

3. Changes to the test suite are shown and documented, e.g., as a patch.

4. Tests are automated, their outcome is documented, e.g., as a test log.

5. The overall work carried out, and experience gained, are documented.In particular, mention your expe-
rience about the given documentation/examples of the project, its tool framework, and the interaction
within your team and with the community of the project.

6. If all tests pass on the original version of the software:
• The issue is (perhaps partially) implemented and documented.
• Previously existing tests pass on the new version. If the issue is fully resolved, new tests must pass as
well.
• There is a patch in an acceptable format.
If some tests related to your issue fail on the original version, and pending bug fixes prevent a full resolution:
• Each bug or issue is documented on the issue tracker of the project.
• Each report is accompanied by at least one automated test case that fails.
